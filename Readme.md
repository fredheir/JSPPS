Zotero style for the Journal of Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society
============

The style is based on Julian Onions' "Chicago Manual of Style 16th edition (full note)"
https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-fullnote-bibliography

This is an early version of the style, created for my own needs. Aspects of the style guide
http://www.ibidem-verlag.de/pdf/preparing_an_english_language_manuscript.pdf
 are likely not implemented, and errors should be expected.
