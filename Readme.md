CSL style for the Journal of Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society
============
The style is written for and tested in Zotero, but may also work in [Mendeley](http://support.mendeley.com/customer/portal/articles/169935-adding-new-citation-styles-to-mendeley-desktop) though not in [Endnote](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/18625/how-to-import-endnote-citation-style-to-zotero/).

The style is based on [Julian Onions' "Chicago Manual of Style 16th edition (full note)"](https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-fullnote-bibliography)

This is an early version of the style, created for my own needs. Aspects of the [style guide](http://www.ibidem-verlag.de/pdf/preparing_an_english_language_manuscript.pdf) are most probably not implemented, and errors should be expected. 


Installation
------------
- Locate your Zotero directory, by clicking "Show Data Directory" in Zotero/preferences/advanced/Files and Folders/ 
- For more details, see [this guide](https://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_data)
- In the Zotero directory, open the "styles" folder, and save the CSL file ([click save as to download raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredheir/JSPPS/master/jspps.csl)). Now restart Zotero.


Changelog, V0.1, 12 September 2014
--------------
The main challenge of the style guide is implementing a mix of features CSL by default assumes to be uniform: the style guide calls for British date formatting (3 July 2014), and German quotation marks, while the style as a whole is based on the American Chicago style. 


- Made GB locale for date formatting
- Changed "Accessed" to "as of" for date of accessing URL resources
- Added URL and date of access for newspaper articles and reports, if these are included
- Modified quotation marks (likely buggy) to match the German standard, e.g. : „RT Editor to Head News Agency,“
- Added punctuation inside quotation marks, as example above
- Changed volume and issue number to format volume:issue
